# DynaBA/PDP BA Helper

## Setting up and running

- Python 3.10 installed at the very least

Using venv:

- Run `python -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment`, recommended path; `.\dynaba`
- Once the venv has been set up, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install pycord and yaml
- Rename the file called dummy-config.yml, and insert your bots token in the token slot.

Your bot should now run perfectly with the `python .\main.py` command!
